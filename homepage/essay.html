        <h1>My New York Essay</h1>
        <h5>Afternoons at Hanco’s</h5>
         <p>I push open the door of Hanco’s, my usual afternoon stop between school and choir practice, and marvel at how many times the little bell has rung for me over the years. Hanco’s is a local Brooklyn Vietnamese fast food chain, started by the son of immigrants. It’s a small dimly lit space filled to the brim with tables and extra chairs stacked against the walls. The counter stands in the spotlight, with a big chalkboard looming over it. The menu includes Vietnamese sandwiches, banh mi, and pho noodle soup, but I only ever get bubble tea. The first time I entered, I was overwhelmed by the eclectic selection, with flavors such as litchi, peach, mango, strawberry, mocha, honeydew, almond, coconut, thai, matcha, and summer specials like watermelon sludge. Having already tried out more than half the menu, I now have a favorite: taro, a purple root-based tea with an earthy taste.</p>
          <p>As I approach the counter, I say hello to the kind lady behind the counter, place my usual order, and head to my favorite spot by the window. Today’s a good day, my armchair is free. It’s an old plush armchair made of cracked black leather, propped on uneven legs, from which you can’t quite reach the round table in front of it. It’s not always available, as neighborhood middle-schoolers tend to favor it. My armchair is the perfect vantage point, a few times a week, to witness the essence of New York.</p>
          <p>I sit down, take out my homework and laptop, and wonder which quintessential New York afternoon I’m about to have. There’s a distinct energy that flows through the small space as New Yorkers come in for a moment to grab a treat, escape from the cold, or just while away time. For years now, I’ve spent the better part of my afternoons in this armchair, observing my surroundings, and I’ve concluded that there are three types of New York.</p>
          <p>The first type of New York is my favorite: the interconnected city. This is when New York feels like a one-horse town and you run into friends who drop by and end up spending the afternoon. The expression ‘it’s a small world’ really comes to mind when you spot your piano teacher sipping on a mocha flavored bubble tea two tables away. Or when your best friend from elementary school pops in for a weekly meetup. The city can feel overwhelming at times, but these moments really make it feel like home.</p>
          <p>There’s also a random side to New York. This type is defined by arbitrary interactions and acts of kindness. Sudden conversations are sparked by strangers you meet in line, waiting for your change. A brush of a shoulder could lead to an invitation to sit down and have boba together. A man in a tracksuit might overhear a conversation with friends and offer up his two cents. The lady behind the counter may knowingly place your order before you have time to say it, and ask how your day is going. Random interactions are what make New York city so special; everyone has a different opinion and everyone is willing to share.</p>
          <p>The third type of New York is anonymous, with everybody too busy for anybody. People rush in and order their food with little interaction, absorbed by their phones and stressed by their hectic lives. These are the faceless people in a crowd, the ones you won’t remember at the end of the day. This is what an outsider might believe defines New York, if they don’t take the time to observe and understand the city’s multiple energies.</p>
          <p>Surprisingly none of the scenarios above happen. Today I’m treated to a quiet parenthesis in the usual bustle of New York City. The door rarely opens, only a few clients tiptoe in, and I’m able to finish my assignment in peace. As I write, I’m reminded how lucky I am to be living in this city, with such a diverse population and a multitude of possibilities just waiting to be discovered. This moment of tranquility is a rare occurrence in the city, tucked away in a boba shop on Smith Street.
